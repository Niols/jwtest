    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
        This thesis aims at applying techniques from deductive program
        verification and analysis of tree transformations to the problem of
        analysing Shell scripts. In particular, we aim at analysing Shell
        scripts that are used in software installation in the Debian GNU/Linux
        distribution. The final goal is to build a proof-of-concept tool able to
        read Debian packages – the way Debian has to distribute software – and
        report on their quality and on the potential bugs they might have.
    </p>

    <p>
        Shell is a scripting language providing control structures around Unix
        utility calls. Unix utilities are objects that can perform all kind of
        transformation on Unix filesystems. We model Unix filesystems using
        feature trees and transformations of Unix filesystems using formulas in
        a feature tree logic named FTS. We describe these modelisations
        extensively and discuss their validity.

        The control structures of Shell scripts are converted to control
        structures in an intermediary language that has clearly defined
        semantics. This involves the definition of this intermediary language,
        the design of a static parser for Shell scripts and of a conversion that
        respects the semantics of both languages.

        The semantics of Shell scripts is then computed using symbolic execution
        of the aforementioned intermediary language, using a database of
        specifications of Unix utility calls as formulas of FTS. The result is,
        for each potential trace of execution of a Shell script, a formula of
        FTS describing the filesystem transformation this trace performs.
    </p>

    <p>
        The main part of the thesis then focuses on decidability of formulas of
        FTS. The goal is to be able to detect traces of execution of Shell
        scripts that cannot happen and to check properties on the Shell scripts,
        such as “if the script fails, then it must not have performed any
        transformation”.

        A first, theoretical, part aims at showing that the full first-order
        theory of FTS is decidable. This goes by first reasoning only on
        Σ₁-formulas of FTS and defining a system of rules R₁ that transforms
        Σ₁-formulas. We show that we can use R₁ to decide the satisfiability of
        Σ₁-formulas as well as some other properties. We then extend the
        reasoning from Σ₁-formulas to first-order formulas of FTS using
        properties of R₁ and weak quantifier eliminations. We conclude by
        stating that the first-order theory of FTS is indeed decidable.

        A second, more practical, part aims at designing efficient decision
        procedures for a subset of FTS rich enough to express the semantics of
        Unix utilities and Shell scripts. This goes by focusing on conjunctive
        formulas and improving on R₁. This results in a system R₂ which is more
        efficient on conjunctive formulas but would not have the required
        properties to prove decidability of the first-order. We then show how R₂
        can be implemented efficiently and that it can be extended without loss
        of efficiency to support specific forms of Σ₁-formulas.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, this thesis describes the applications of the theoretical work
        to the implementation of a toolchain able to analyse all software
        packages in the Debian distribution and report on them. We describe our
        analysis and the bugs that we have found during the whole project. This
        thesis takes place within the CoLiS project, ANR-15-CE25-0001, taking
        place from October 2015 to March 2021.
